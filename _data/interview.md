## Why do you leave Morningstar?

At that time, we were using C# in our project, the backend service is an asp.net website. However, my manager's backend was in the C++ area. I could not get too much instruction from him. I was not sure if I could learn more from him. Also, some other senior developers were backend in the C++ area. The techniques used in our project were not quite up to date.  I could not find many people in our teams to discuss technique evolution and how to use new techniques in our product, so I decided to leave Morningstar.

## What did you learn in Moodys?

Why do you stay so long in Moodys?
I joined a new team in Moodys, people in my team and other teams are young and enthusiastic. I learned a lot from my colleagues. We can discuss and learn new techniques together and use that to improve our product. Also, Moodys has a very human orientation culture. It encourages employees to learn new things and improve themselves. I think it is a good place to learn and grow. It also encourages work-life balance. I think it is a good place to work.

## What is your biggest achievement in Moodys?

In a new project Risk Compass, I set up a search engine with Elasticsearch to support the search feature of the whole platform. It is a very challenging project. The official Elasticsearch does not support Chinese and Chinese Pinyin searches. I had to make a lot of customization to make it work.
