## Why do you leave Morningstar?

At that time, we were using C# in our project, the backend service is an asp.net website. However, my manager's backend was in the C++ area. I could not get too much instruction from him. I was not sure if I could learn more from him. Also, some other senior developers were backend in the C++ area. The techniques used in our project were not quite up to date.  I could not find many people in our teams to discuss technique evolution and how to use new techniques in our product, so I decided to leave Morningstar.

Why do you stay so long in Moodys?
I joined a new team in Moodys, people in my team and other teams are young and enthusiastic. I learned a lot from my colleagues. We can discuss and learn new techniques together and use that to improve our product. Also, Moodys has a very human orientation culture. It encourages employees to learn new things and improve themselves. I think it is a good place to learn and grow. It also encourages work-life balance. I think it is a good place to work.

In a new project Risk Compass, I set up a search engine with Elasticsearch to support the search feature of the whole platform. It is a very challenging project. The official Elasticsearch does not support Chinese and Chinese Pinyin searches. I had to make a lot of customization to make it work.

## challenge case

In 2018 and 2019, I successfully organized an internal hackathon at Moody's Shenzhen office in my capacity as an organizer. The success of the 2018 event caught the interest of Moody's Analytics Accelerator (MAA) globally, leading to its promotion across major global offices. In collaboration with MAA in 2019, a larger-scale event was held. As one of the Moody's MAA global office Hackday event series, the event required adherence to MAA's provided guidelines and standards while incorporating local features. I worked closely with personnel from multiple departments to ensure the smooth execution of the event. Ultimately, the event was successful, with 17 teams participating in several interesting POC projects, and five different field awards being presented to deserving candidates. One of the POC projects ultimately made it into production and became a new product for Moody's.
